## Research Question and Motivation
<div class="blue"> Research Question </div> What were the impacts of the tightened mortgage policy and the increase in comprehensive real estate tax applied to multiple homeowners on Korean housing prices?

<div class="blue"> Housing Price Context </div>

- 24 housing policy changes during President Moon's 5-year term

- Regulate purchase of apartments for investment purposes

- Housing prices soared i.e. 52 percent increase in apartment prices in Seoul

## Research Context
<div class="blue"> Mortgage Loan Policy Context </div>
* Regulations on the mortgage loan in some regions were strengthened in 2017 

<font size ="3">
 - For 5 regions subject to adjustment, LTV (Loan-To-Value) and DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratio decreased by 10%p, while for other 12 regions there was no policy change. 
</font size> 

<div class="blue"> Comprehensive Real Estate Tax Context </div>
- National tax on land and residential properties
- First introduced in 2005 to slow the 22% increase in housing prices by targeting owners with properties that have high appraised value or multiple homeowners
- Remained at an average of 1.15% from 2009 to 2018. Since then, increased to 2019: 1.35%, 2021: 3.66%

## Data Description and Sources
<div class="blue"> Data Source </div> All data was derived from Korean Statistical Information Service (kosis.kr), excluding Comprehensive Real Estate Tax Rate from National Tax Service (nts.go.kr)

<div class="blue"> Data Description </div>
- Average Housing Sale Price: Unit of observation = individual apartment sale prices, Population = all saleable apartments, houses, and townhouses of 261 cities, counties, and districts of South Korea
- Bank of Korea Policy Rate
- Average Monthly Income: Unit of observation = individual monthly income, Pouplation = every worker that received income in exchange for labor of 261 cities, counties, and districts of South Korea

## Methodology: Empirical Strategy
<div class="blue"> Empirical Strategy </div>

<div> Loan regulation: Cross-sectional and panel data analysis </div>

<font size ="4">

Cross-sectional: non-adjusted v. adjusted regions after policy change

Diff-in-diff: non-adjusted v. adjusted regions before/after policy change

FE model: See the effect of the implementation of stronger regulation on adjusted regions on housing price, controlling for region(time-variant but constant across regions, e.g. interest rate, national-level macro economic indexes such as inflation rate) and time fixed (vary across regions, but consistent over time, e.g. demographic features and demand for housing) effects. </font size>

<div>Comprehensive Real Estate Tax (CRET) Rate increase: OLS </div>
<font size ="4">

OLS: see variation in average housing sale prices after policy change of increasing the CRET rate to both adjustment and non-adjustment areas (at different levels) was implemented</font size>

## Methodology: Key Explanatory and Dependent Variables
<div class="blue"> Definition </div>
- Dependent variable = Average Housing Sale Price of each month in each region (2012~2022.Sep.)
- Explanatory variable 1 = CRET Rate, defined as the average of the different tax rates imposed on residential properties based on appraised value, applied equally across regions until 2021 when adjustment regions were introduced
- Explanatory variable 2 = Treatment, defined as a binary variable indicating if the region is subject to strengthened LTV, DTI ratio or not(0: all regions before policy change & non-adjusted regions after policy change / 1: adjusted regions after policy change )

## Dependent Variable : Average Housing Price by Region

This map shows the average housing sale price by region. Seoul has the highest average price, followed by the outskirts of Seoul.
